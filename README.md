# findAmeaning.py
Input a word and find the meaning. 

A very small program that scrapes the site
dictionary.com for the meanings of words. If
a word cannot be found there the system will
scrape urbandictionary.com for a matching slang
term. 

Thought it might be a handy piece of code for 
a quick word meaning. 

Thank you to Beautiful Soup for an amazing 
libaray!
