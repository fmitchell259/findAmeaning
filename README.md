# findAmeaning.py
Input a word and find the meaning. 

A very small program that scrapes the site
vocabulary.com for the meanings of words. 

It's by no means perfect. but will find a 
lot of word meanings. 

As I get more familiar with the BeauitfulSoup 
library, and unravel the HTML within the 
Oxford Dictionary site DOM, the system will 
improve. 

But for now, thought it might be a handy little
piece of code for a quick word meaning. 

Thank you to Beautiful Soup for an amazing 
libaray!
