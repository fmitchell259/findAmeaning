# findAmeaning.py
Input a word and find the meaning. 

A very small program that scrapes the site
vocabulary.com for the meanings of words. 

It's by no means perfect. but will find a 
lot of word meanings. Instead of scraping
from vocabulary.com I will adjust the system
to scrape from dictionary.com, which provides
more, accurate answers. 

Thought it might be a handy piece of code for 
a quick word meaning. 

Thank you to Beautiful Soup for an amazing 
libaray!
